Gas-fired packaged rooftop unit (RTU),D305006,"Replace gas-fired packaged RTU systems with air-source heat pump RTUs, water-to-air heat pumps, or variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems. Dual fuel heat pump RTUs are permitted where it is not practical to fully electrify due to coldclimate zones, large system size requirements, or mission-critical uses. Agencies should determine dual fuel applicability based on a site-specific evaluation that considers the heating load, technological availability at the time of replacement, and climate considerations throughout the heating season.",D303002,"Some heat pump models report heating capacity at 0F to 10F outdoor air temperature although there is no standardized cold-climate specification for RTUs or VRF systems. When available, dual fuel gas-electric heat pump RTUs are a relatively straightforward retrofit for gas-fired RTUs."
Gas furnaces,D302002,Replace split-system ACs and gas furnaces with ducted split-system heat pumps or ducted mini-split heat pumps. Gas furnaces may continue to be used for backup heating only if cold-climate heat pumps that function in heat pump mode to meet demand in colder climate zones are not commercialavailable. The primary system must be electrified.,D303002,"Split-system heat pumps are available for both residential (1-5 ton) and light commercial (6-20 ton) capacities although cold-climate certifications are only available for residential-style models. Cold-climate heat pump solutions are available for residential capacities (up to 5 tons) and can operate down to -15°F outdoor air temperature. Larger furnaces/air handling units (AHUs) may not have direct heat pump equivalents. Heat pump replacement of larger capacity furnaces/AHUs may have space constraints (i.e., mechanical closet size)."
"Low temperature boilers (110°F to 140°F), Medium temperature boilers (150°F to 180°F), Steam boiler systems",D302001,"Conversion to air-to-water and water-to-water heat pumps, including heat recovery chillers where simultaneous chilled water and hot water loads are common throughout the year. Consider ground-source heat exchangers. Decommission hydronic heating system and conversion to VRF or distributed ductless split-system systems.",D303002,"Comparisons of size, weight, and installation complexity to conventional boiler and chiller systems will vary. Most hydronic heat pump systems provide lower hot water supply temperatures (110-140°F) than traditional boilers. Buildings may require weatherization to reduce heating loads and radiator redesign to meet building heating needs without replacing hot water piping. Auxiliary electric resistance or gas-fired boilers may be needed for colder climates as boosters."
Air Handling Units (AHUs) with reheat or perimeter space heating,D304008,"Assess current heating source within AHU or variable air volume (VAV) boxes. If served by hydronic loop, consider hydronic heat pump solutions described above. If served by electric resistance heating elements, consider additional energy efficiency measures to minimize consumption. Major renovation projects could consider conversion to VRF, ground-source heat pumps (GSHP), or other heat pump options.",D303002,
Campus/district chilled water and steam systems,D304006,Transition buildings from steam or medium temperature hot water (over 160°F) to low temperature hot water (less than 140°F) and use large heat recovery chillers to generate hot and cold water. Use a centralized well field with large centralized hydronic heat pumps that distribute hot or cold water to each building or an ambient hydronic loop between the well field and buildings with water-source heat pumps at each building. Transition individual buildings from the campus or district energy system to a decentralized system with heat pumps located at each building.,,Conversion to a low temperature piping network requires updates to building distribution systems as well as larger central system piping. Moving to a decentralized system may present space constraints at each building and could pose challenges for the performance of the overall district system.

Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC),D305006,"Replace PTACs with packaged terminal heat pumps (PTHPs). Major renovation projects could consider switching from PTAC/PTHP system designs to centralized systems, such as commercial unitary heat pumps (CUHPs), VRFs, or other options.",D303002,"Very limited availability of cold-climate PTHPs. Consider ventilation impacts when using PTAC/PTHPs, and assess whether ventilation requirements should be fulfilled by a secondary system such as a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS)."
"Gas-fired unit heaters, radiant heaters, and other miscellaneous heating systems",D305002,"Replace with electric resistance and electric radiant options. Consider installing ductless splitsystem heat pumps, VRF, and PTHPs in place of or in combination with electric resistance and radiant options.",D303002,
Ventilation makeup air units,D304090,Replace with heat pump and other electric make-up air units and DOAS units.,D303002,Rate of make-up air cubic feet per minute (cfm) and anticipated outdoor conditions will dictate retrofit selection.
Combined Heat and Power (CHP),D302090,"Replace gas-fired CHP systems at large buildings or campuses with electric heat pump solutions, which could include one or more strategies: 1) Use large air-to-water, waterto-water, or heat recovery chillers; 2) Use a centralized well field with hydronic heat pumps either centrally located or distributed at each building; or 3) Transition individual buildings from campus/district energy systems to decentralized allelectric heating systems located at each building.",D303002,"Few case studies and analyses have been done to evaluate the energy, cost, emissions, space and resilience impacts with campuswide heat recovery chillers and/or a decentralized heat pump strategy. Electrification upgrades should be considered towards the end of life of key CHP equipment. Buildings/campuses with steam or medium temperature hot water (>160°F) may need to transition to low temperature hot water (<140°F). Moving to a decentralized system may present space constraints at each building"
Gas hot water boiler for central domestic hot water (DHW),D202003,"Heat pump water heater (HPWH) depending on temperature and appropriately sized storage and booster tanks to meet application and recovery needs. -If lowering the temperature of central DHW, facilities must follow all supply and storage guidelines under ASHRAE 188 to inhibit the growth of opportunistic pathogens like Legionella, which is the bacteria that causes Legionnaire's disease.",D303002,"Commercial buildings with high hot water loads (e.g., food service, lodging, gyms, dormitories, healthcare) typically have large storage water heaters with high recovery rates. Size of heat pump and storage need to be matched to anticipated loads to ensure sufficient hot water and good recovery."
Gas resistance water heater for smaller DHW applications,D202003,HPWH can suffice for most lightcommercial applications. Instantaneous electric water heater for small hot water loads (point-of-use) and eliminate recirculation pumping.,D303002,Residential and light commercial HPWHs are available today from major manufacturers with storage capacities of 40-120 gallons.
Small electric storage/point-of use systems,D202003,"Electric models required. Small point of-use water heaters (e.g., office kitchenettes, under-sink units in washrooms) commonly use electricity today.",D303002,"Unlikely to convert to heat pumps due to technical, economic, or physical feasibility constraints."
