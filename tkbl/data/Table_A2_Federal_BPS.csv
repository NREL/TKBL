Gas hot water boiler for central domestic hot water (DHW),D202003,"Heat pump water heater (HPWH) depending on temperature and appropriately sized storage and booster tanks to meet application and recovery needs.  -If lowering the temperature of central DHW, facilities must follow all supply and storage guidelines under ASHRAE 188 to inhibit the growth of opportunistic pathogens like Legionella, which is the bacteria that causes Legionnaire’s disease. ",D303002,"Commercial buildings with high hot water loads (e.g., food service, lodging, gyms, dormitories, healthcare) typically have large storage water heaters with high recovery rates. Size of heat pump and storage need to be matched to anticipated loads to ensure sufficient hot water and good recovery. "
Gas resistance water heater for smaller DHW applications,D202003,HPWH can suffice for most lightcommercial applications.  Instantaneous electric water heater for small hot water loads (point-of-use) and eliminate recirculation pumping. ,D303002,Residential and light commercial HPWHs are available today from major manufacturers with storage capacities of 40-120 gallons.  
Small electric storage/point-of use systems,D202003,"Electric models required. Small point of-use water heaters (e.g., office kitchenettes, under-sink units in washrooms) commonly use electricity today. ",D303002,"Unlikely to convert to heat pumps due to technical, economic, or physical feasibility constraints. "
